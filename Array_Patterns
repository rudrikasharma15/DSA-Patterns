# 🌟 Array DSA Patterns
**Author: Rudrika Sharma**

---

## 1. 🪟 Sliding Window
Use when the problem involves subarrays of fixed or dynamic size (max/min/sum).

### 🔹 Examples:
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- Longest Subarray with Sum ≤ K
- Minimum Size Subarray Sum
- Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Elements *(applies to strings too)*

---

## 2. 🎯 Two Pointers
Use when working with sorted arrays or optimizing space.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Two Sum II – Input is Sorted
- Merge Sorted Arrays (in-place)
- Move Zeroes

---

## 3. ➕ Prefix Sum
Use when calculating range sums or cumulative patterns.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Subarray Sum Equals K
- Find Pivot Index
- Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum
- Range Sum Query

---

## 4. 🧠 Hashing (HashMap / HashSet)
Use when frequency, fast lookup, or uniqueness matters.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Two Sum
- Subarray with 0 Sum
- Contains Duplicate / Nearby Duplicate
- Longest Consecutive Sequence

---

## 5. 📈 Monotonic Stack / Deque
Use for next greater/smaller elements or range queries.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Next Greater Element
- Daily Temperatures
- Largest Rectangle in Histogram
- Sliding Window Maximum

---

## 6. 🔍 Binary Search on Answer
Use when searching for minimum or maximum valid value under constraints.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- Koko Eating Bananas
- Minimum Number of Days to Make M Bouquets
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays

---

## 7. ⚡ Greedy
Use when local optimal decisions lead to a global optimum.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Jump Game I / II
- Gas Station
- Candy Distribution
- Merge Intervals

---

## 8. 💥 Kadane's Algorithm
Use when finding the maximum subarray sum.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Maximum Subarray
- Maximum Circular Subarray
- Max Sum of 2 Non-Overlapping Subarrays

---

## 9. 🧮 Sorting + Two Pointers
Use when dealing with pairs/triplets and difference minimization.

### 🔹 Examples:
- 3Sum / 4Sum
- Closest Pair from Two Arrays
- Meeting Rooms

---

## 10. 🧾 Difference Array (Advanced)
Use for efficient multiple range updates.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Range Addition
- Flight Booking System

---

## 11. 🧩 Bit Manipulation
Use for toggling bits, XOR tricks, or subset generation.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Single Number
- Find Missing Number
- Subsets using Bitmasks

---

## 12. 🔁 Backtracking on Arrays
Use to generate all combinations, permutations, or partitions.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Subsets / Subsets II
- Permutations
- Combination Sum

**💡 Tip:**  
Mastering these patterns helps solve 90% of array-based problems in interviews and platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG.

Happy Coding! 💻✨
